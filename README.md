This webserver is meant to be used as nginx, but it is far from it.
Nevertheless as it was a 3 people project the code is easily handleable.
If you look carefully you'll find a hided doc for our configuration files managment.
Make it better that nginx and enjoy being the new most used HTTP server in the world XDDDDD
